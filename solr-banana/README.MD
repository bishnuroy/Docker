## What is Solr?

[Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) (pronounced "solar") is an open source enterprise search platform, written in Java, from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, NoSQL features[1] and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Providing distributed search and index replication, Solr is designed for scalability and Fault tolerance.
